= GIT TOOLS
================================================================================


    Git tools is a set of useful scripts to help you do things simpler
    with git.

    I am pretty sure that they won't run on all envs. but what they
    really need is just a bit of really simple twicking.


= git-download
================================================================================

  Changes to every other branch that you have checked out and executes a pull on it
  Finally, it will check out the initial branch that you were using in the begining

    cd my_repo
    git download


= git-get-branches
================================================================================

  Will download all the remote branches and set them up as tracking branches

= git-when
================================================================================

  Will display all the currently checked out branches and their last modified time
